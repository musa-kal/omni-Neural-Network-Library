**OMNI** is an experimental **machine learning library** built entirely with **Python** and **NumPy**.  
It’s currently a **work in progress**, serving as both a learning project and a sandbox for exploring and implementing core machine learning concepts from scratch.

The goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the mathematical and logical foundations behind machine learning algorithms - by building them from the ground up, without relying on high-level frameworks.

---

### 🚧 Current Status
OMNI is under active development.  
Expect frequent changes and experimental implementations as the library evolves.

---

### 💡 Vision
- Implement core ML algorithms from scratch using NumPy.  
- Focus on clarity, educational value, and mathematical correctness.  
- Gradually expand towards neural networks and optimization techniques.
